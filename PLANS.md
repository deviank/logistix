# Project Plans & Next Steps

Use this file to track what you want to work on in your next session.

## Next Session Plans

- For the items that gets moved to the uploads folder can we rather get folders created with the year as indication. This will make it easier to search.
- When filtering statuses there should be a total at the bottom of the status column for that particular status that was selected.
- Add search functionality to invoices dashboard as well.

## Ideas & Notes

- Hover or click on Dashboard Overview tiles for invoices should show a history graph (this could lead to a planner should turnover be different every month)
- A tile in the dasboard area to measure the prvious months take ins or turnovers for my brother in law use to seee how the month is tracking or profitable

## Issues picked up

- Load management dash doesn't have proper filtering for statuses
